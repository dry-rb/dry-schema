    Inferring predicates from class names is deprecated. It's very unlikely your code depends on it,
      however, if it does, you'll get an exception with instructions. (@flash-gordon)

      If you see an exception and don't rely on inferring, just disable it with:

      ```ruby
      Dry::Schema::PredicateInferrer::Compiler.infer_predicate_by_class_name false
      ```

      Otherwise, enable it explicitly:

      ```ruby
      Dry::Schema::PredicateInferrer::Compiler.infer_predicate_by_class_name true
      ```

      See https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-schema/issues/335 for rationale.
