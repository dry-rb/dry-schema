    Inferring predicates from class names is deprecated. It's very unlikely your code depends on it,

      ```ruby
      Dry::Schema::PredicateInferrer::Compiler.infer_predicate_by_class_name false

    #97) (@solnic)'
  changed:
  - "[BREAKING] Updated to work with `dry-types 0.15.0` (@flash-gordon)"
  - "[BREAKING] `Result#{errors,messages,hints}` returns `MessageSet` object now which
    is an enumerable coercible to a hash (@solnic)"

    (issue #29) (@solnic)"

    [BREAKING] Configuration for message backends is now nested under `messages` key with following settings:
      - `messages.backend` - previously `messages`
      - `messages.load_paths` - previously `messages_path`
      - `messages.namespace` - previously `namespace`
      - `messages.top_namespace` - **new setting** see above
  - "[BREAKING] `Messages::I18n` uses `I18.store_translations` instead of messing
    with `I18n.load_path` (@solnic)"
  - Schemas (`Params` and `JSON`) have nicer inspect (@solnic)
- version: 0.3.0
  date: '2018-03-04'
  fixed:
  - Configuration is properly inherited from a parent schema (@skryukov)
  - "`Result#error?` returns `true` when a preceding key has errors (@solnic)"
  - Predicate inferrer no longer chokes on sum, constructor and enum types (@solnic)
  - Predicate inferrer infers `:bool?` from boolean types (@solnic)
  - Block-based definitions using `array` works correctly (@solnic)
  - Using a disjunction with `array` and `hash` produces correct errors when element
    validation for array failed (@solnic)
  changed:
  - Required ruby version was removed from gemspec for people who are stuck on MRI
    2.3.x (@solnic)
- version: 0.2.0
  date: '2019-02-26'
  added:
  - New `hash` macro which prepends `hash?` type-check and allows nested schema definition
    (@solnic)
  - New `array` macro which works like `each` but prepends `array?` type-check (@solnic)
  fixed:
  - 'Rule name translation works correctly with I18n (issue #52) (@solnic)'
  - 'Rule name translation works correctly with namespaced messages (both I18n and
    plain YAML) (issue #57) (@solnic)'

    #53) (@solnic)'

    schemas (issue #49) (@solnic)'
  - 'Child schema can override inherited rules now (issue #66) (@skryukov)'
  - 'Hints are correctly generated for disjunction that use type-check predicates
    (issue #24) (@solnic)'

    (@solnic)"

  changed:
  - "[BREAKING] **Messages are now configured under `dry_schema` namespace by default**
    (issue #38) (@solnic)"
  - "[BREAKING] Hints are now an optional feature provided by `:hints` extension,
    to load it do `Dry::Schema.load_extensions(:hints)` (@solnic)"
  - "[BREAKING] Hints generation was improved in general, output of `Result#messages`
    and `Result#hints` changed in some cases (@solnic)"
